Task:

You have to write a function remainder which takes two arguments : D(Dividend) and d(Divisor) and returns the remainder when D(Dividend) is divided by d(Divisor).

Assumptions:

The Arguments will always be an Integer.
D(Dividend) will always be greater than or equal to d(Divisor).
Note:

Make sure that the implemented remainder function works exactly same as the Modulus Operator(%) does i.e. m % 0 = NaN ∀ m ∈ ℕ the only difference would be that here 'NaN' will be a string.
